As an active Blogger user, we would like to invite you to be one of the first to try out Googles new email service, Gmail.
Would you like to give it a whirl? **YES** / NO
----------------------
Special Gmail Offer
Great. To help set up your account, we need to send to Gmail (a Google-owned service) the first name, last name and email address specified in your Blogger account. This information will only be used to kick-start your account setup. Until you submit your Gmail registration, this information will not be saved and you will have the chance to change it.

We do not pass along any other personal information to Gmail without your explicit permission. (Please see our Privacy Policy for more information)
**Sounds Good!**　　　 No Thanks.

---------------------
Got Gmail?
Weve been busy testing and improving Gmail. Now, were eager for more users to try it out and let us know what they think. As a long time Google user, we thought youd be adventurous enough to really dive in and give Gmail a thorough test.

Were inviting you to use Gmail because we really value your opinion and want to hear your feedback. The link you followed to this page can only be used once. We hope youll honor our limited test by using this invite for yourself. You can also learn more about Gmail before registering.
**Sign me up for Gmail!**　　 Nevermind, Im not interested.

First off, welcome. And thanks for agreeing to help us test Gmail. By now you probably know the key ways in which Gmail differs from traditional webmail services. Searching instead of filing. A free gigabyte of storage. Messages displayed in context as conversations.
......
Youre one of the very first people to use Gmail. Your input will help determine how it evolves, so we encourage you to send your feedback, suggestions and questions to us. But mostly, we hope youll enjoy experimenting with Googles approach to email.
